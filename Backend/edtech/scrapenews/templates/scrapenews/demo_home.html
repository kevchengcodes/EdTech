      <h3 style="font-style: italic;">Learning better, together.</h3>
      <p>Humans are social creatures. We learn best when we can work together and connect abstract concepts
        to real-life applications. WeMinari aims to provide a platform for students and instructors to
        collaborate together and apply their learnings in the real world. WeMinari's mission is to
        create a digital environment to foster an
        <strong>active, adaptive, social, and contextualized</strong> learning experience that connects classroom
        content with real-world context.
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-header" style="color:rgba(0, 156, 158, 1)">STUDENTS</h3>
      <p>
        WeMinari is designed to optimize the student's learning enjoyment and performance. 
        Their main feed is populated with news articles related to their coursework. As they use the app 
        more and save articles that they enjoyed, their main feed will <strong>adapt</strong> to their 
        behavior to meet their individualized interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The UX is also designed to fit their learning style and cognitive learning model. A cognitive
        model questionnaire will direct them either to a cozy, minimalist view of their main landing page 
        for those who prefer less clutter, or to a full, info-packed view for those who prefer having
        everything in one, convenient location.
      </p>
        Students will also have exposure to opportunities outside of their classroom with external partners,
        like companies or community groups in their field of interest. This might come in the form of projects
        that students can work on, tours, or networking/recruiting events. In this way, students can engage
        with these partners to supplement their learning with <strong>active</strong> and 
        <strong>contextualized</strong> hands-on activities.
      <p>
      <p>
        While working on these projects or perusing their main feeds, students will want to share things, ask
        questions, or discuss ideas with their classmates, instructor, and external partners. WeMinari acts as a 
        social media app and learning management system combination to enable students to collaborate effectively
        in a responsible, engaging, and <strong>social</strong> manner.
      </p>
        
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-header" style="color:blue">INSTRUCTORS</h3>
      <p>
        Instructors are the head of the class. WeMinari empowers instructors to guide their classroom 
        without being too obtrusive. They can view key statistics on each student's performance and engagement
        in the app, look through available projects and other opportunities that they'd like to include
        as part of their curriculum, make announcements to their class, and moderate any online discussion
        that occurs in the app.
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-header" style="color:seagreen">PARTNERS</h3>
      <p>
        Last but not least, external partners can engage with a classroom as long as an instructor 
        initiates a connection. They'll have the ability to create projects, manage their projects, 
        and work with students on each individual project/opportunity that gets matched.
